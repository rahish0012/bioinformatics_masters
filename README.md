Proteomics: implementing machine learning models using protein and phosphosite data 

Transcriptomics: Bulk RNA-seq data from mice. Differential gene expression analysis is conducted using DESeq2; pathway and further downstream analysis conducted using ClusterProfiler.

scRNA seq analysis: Implemented a Seurat workflow in R to analyze pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma data: processsed the expression data to filter the mitochondrial genes, scaled the data, used PCA analysis for clustering and dimensionality reduction, visualized clusters using t-SNE and UMAP. 

NGS final report: An example of a full bioinformatic workflow involving deploying the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, conducting QC, normalization, and other required pre-processing, performing differential gene expression, and summarizing the findings. The emphasis in this project is in the bioinformatic methods used rather than the actual biological significance of the data. The results of the multiQC and further downstream analysis are summarized in the report. 

spatial trancriptomics: This project analyzes 10x Genomics Visium FFPE spatial transcriptomics data from a coronal section of the adult mouse brain. Using the Seurat framework in R, I performed normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and spatially variable gene detection to explore regional gene expression patterns across the tissue.
