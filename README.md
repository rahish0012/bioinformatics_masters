Next Generation Sequencing: R code assessing the differential gene expression landscape in control tumors vs. tumors treated with siRNA agianst NRDE2. 
The workflow follows downstream analysis after deploying the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline

Proteomics: implementing machine learning models using protein and phosphosite data 

Transcriptomics: Bulk RNA-seq data from mice. Differential gene expression analysis is conducted using DESeq2; pathway and further downstream analysis conducted using ClusterProfiler.

scRNA seq analysis: Implemented a Seurat workflow in R to analyze pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma data: processsed the expression data to filter the mitochondrial genes, scaled the data, used PCA analysis for clustering and dimensionality reduction, visualized clusters using t-SNE and UMAP.
